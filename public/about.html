<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

  Hi, I’m Derrick Martins, a 35-year-old tech enthusiast passionate about technology and its endless possibilities. Over
  the years, I’ve dedicated myself to learning and expanding my skills in coding, currently diving deep into HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript, Node, React, and Python. I’m driven by a strong curiosity and the desire to build innovative solutions.

  I had the incredible opportunity to live in the U.S. for over eight years, where I learned English and broadened my
  horizons. My time there helped me not only grow personally but also professionally, as I gained invaluable experiences
  that shaped my worldview.

  I’ve been happily married for 10 years and have four wonderful kids. My family is my rock, and they inspire me to push
  forward in everything I do. When it comes to work, I am known for being incredibly hard-working and dedicated.
  Currently, I work as a bilingual Night Auditor at the Fasano Hotel, where I am responsible for various duties,
  including customer service and hotel operations.

  Now, I’m eager to take my passion for technology to the next level by finding my first job in the tech industry. With
  my experience in customer service and my growing technical skills, I’m excited to contribute to a team where I can
  continue to learn and make an impact.</p>
